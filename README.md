# HR_data_analysis
In this project, we as a Data Analyst, analyse a real attendance data set(3 month period) from a company called Atliq accordiing to the requirements of the stakeholders(HR).
**Business Requirements:** The stakeholders wanted to see the attendance %, WFH %, Sick leave %(can be used to see a virus breakout in the office premises). 
We collect data from a Excel Workbook, clean and transform it according to the business needs. 
Then we build a dashboard to analyse trends in the attendance of employees.
The future business requirements of the stakeholders included automating emails, automatic data refresh, setting security levels(RLS and OLS) which can be achieved in PowerBI.
